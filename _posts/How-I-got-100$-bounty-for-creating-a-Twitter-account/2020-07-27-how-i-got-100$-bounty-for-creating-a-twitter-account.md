This is the story of my first bug bounty. "How i got 100$ bounty by creating a Twitter account.". I hope you'll enjoy it ðŸ˜‰.

I was just googling around for a new target and after some time i found a website, let's call it redacted.com.

I was going through the website and found that there was a dedicated page for their social media accounts (redacted.com/community). Now you may ask why to care about it ? You'll find out soon.

So, after i saw the page i just got only one feeling. What was that ? 
I just started to open every profile url. After 3 or 4 clicks i saw an error. It was:

Then i was like:

<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="7890844" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.3333333333333333"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/he-hehe-boy-boi-boyi-gif-7890844">He Hehe GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/he-gifs">He GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

I rushed to my twitter account settings and clicked on change username. And tried registering the username from "redacted.com" which wasn't opening and "__BOOM__" username changed successfully.

<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="8478631" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="1.3707865168539326"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/boom-gif-8478631">Boom Late Night Show GIF</a> from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/boom-gifs">Boom GIFs</a></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

There were still so many profiles remaining on the website. So i tried opening all of them and at the end i was sitting with 3 new twitter accounts & 1 instagram account. 

I Reported the the issue to redacted.com and it got triaged and resolved next day. And i got the bounty that same day.
